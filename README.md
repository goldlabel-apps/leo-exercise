#### Install & Run

Clone the repository, install dependencies & start dev server. Default browser opens to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Once you have setup dev you can checkout the repo at any commit or tag

```bash
cd <working-dir>
git clone https://github.com/listingslab-software/leo-exercise.git
yarn && yarn start
```

## Tech Stack

Before bootstrapping the app I consider the simplest possible solution to meet the requirement. Arguably a Shopping Cart needs something like Redux to manage state. The best and easiest to use implementation I've come across is [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org). Bootstrapping React is easy with [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). If we use the template `redux-typescript`, it gives us the techstack we want
- React
	- TypeScript
	- Redux

The npm package runner `npx` gives us the following bash command 

```bash
# Redux + TypeScript template
npx create-react-app leo-exercise --template redux-typescript
````

## Step 1: Shopping cart 

Next job is to create our app from the template provided. Along the way I remove any extraneous files the project doesn't need. At this point we will also add [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) to the project because we'll need some User Interface componenets. Now we're set up we can concentrate on just 2 files. `Cart.tsx` handles the frontend and `cartSlice.ts` the logic

### [Cart.tsx](./src/features/cart/Cart.tsx)

Renders the cart and handles UI interaction and updates from Redux

_eg_

```javascript

  const cart = useAppSelector(useCart)
  const { 
    totalItems,
    totalPense, 
  } = cart
  const readablePrice = `Â£${(Math.round(totalPense) / 100).toFixed(2)}`
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()

  return <Button onClick={() => dispatch( addItem( 'apple' ) )} >
    Add to Cart
  </Button>

```

### [cartSlice.ts](./src/features/cart/cartSlice.ts)


Here we setup the function for adding an item to the cart. Because this is place, we add our transformer code here too. This transforms the simple array of strings into an object called `cart` which the Cart.tsx component can more easily consume

```javascript
export const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'cart',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    addItem: (state, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {
      state.items = [...state.items, action.payload]
      // Translate into useful object
      const items = state.items
      const cart = {
        totalItems: 0,
        totalPense: 0,
      }
      for ( let i = 0; i < items.length; i ++){
        const item = items[i]
        if ( item === `apple` ) {
          cart.totalPense += 60
        }
        if ( item === `orange` ) {
          cart.totalPense += 25
        }
        cart.totalItems += 1
      }
      state.cart = { ...state.cart, ...cart }
    }
  }
})
```

All that remains is to connect these two concerns together to produce a frontend which meets the requirement. This concludes Step 1, so we commit, push, tag and move on to Step 2

## Step 2: Deals

If we've done Step 1 well, this should take very little time
